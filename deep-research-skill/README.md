# Deep Research Skill for Claude Code

Enterprise-grade research engine for Claude Code. Produces citation-backed reports with source credibility scoring, multi-provider search, and automated validation.

## Installation

Clone the repo and read `SKILL.md` to get started. No additional dependencies required for basic usage.

### Optional: search-cli (multi-provider search)

For aggregated search across Brave, Serper, Exa, Jina, and Firecrawl:

```bash
brew tap 199-biotechnologies/tap && brew install search-cli
search config set keys.brave YOUR_KEY  # configure at least one provider
```

## Usage

```
deep research on the current state of quantum computing
```

```
deep research in ultradeep mode: compare PostgreSQL vs Supabase for our stack
```

## Research Modes

| Mode | Phases | Duration | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| Quick | 3 | 2-5 min | Initial exploration |
| Standard | 6 | 5-10 min | Most research questions |
| Deep | 8 | 10-20 min | Complex topics, critical decisions |
| UltraDeep | 8+ | 20-45 min | Comprehensive reports, maximum rigor |

## Pipeline

Scope &rarr; Plan &rarr; **Retrieve** (parallel search + agents) &rarr; Triangulate &rarr; Outline Refinement &rarr; Synthesize &rarr; Critique (with loop-back) &rarr; Refine &rarr; Package

Key features:
- **Step 0**: Retrieves current date before searches (prevents stale training-data year assumptions)
- **Parallel retrieval**: 5-10 concurrent searches + 2-3 focused sub-agents returning structured evidence objects
- **First Finish Search**: Adaptive quality thresholds by mode
- **Critique loop-back**: Phase 6 can return to Phase 3 with delta-queries if critical gaps found
- **Multi-persona red teaming**: Skeptical Practitioner, Adversarial Reviewer, Implementation Engineer (Deep/UltraDeep)
- **Disk-persisted citations**: `sources.json` survives context compaction and continuation agents

## Output

Reports saved to `~/Documents/[Topic]_Research_[Date]/`:
- Markdown (primary source of truth)

Reports >18K words auto-continue via recursive agent spawning with context preservation.

## Quality Standards

- 10+ sources, 3+ per major claim
- Executive summary 200-400 words
- Findings 600-2,000 words each, prose-first (>=80%)
- Full bibliography with URLs, no placeholders

## Search Tools

| Tool | When | Setup |
|------|------|-------|
| WebSearch | Default, always available | None |
| Exa MCP | Semantic/neural search | MCP config |
| search-cli | Multi-provider aggregation | `brew install search-cli` + API keys |
